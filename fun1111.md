**In this report, I will design Debugging Scenario, and write a report as a conversation on EdStem.**

Description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is: 
As we can see from the Junit test output, the expected list output is `[0, 2, 4]`. However, the actual list output is `[4, 2, 0]`, which contains the same element but with the opposite order. Therefore, we might guess that the `checkString` method is implemented correctly but the bug is probably accuring at the place where we add the index of the element which returns true in the `checkString`. The failure-inducing input is the String list provided to the filter method, which is `["s","b","s","a","s"]`.

A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try:
One leading question is that whether the index of the element which returns true in the `checkString` is added at the end of the result list each time, which is crucial to retain the same order they appeared in the input list.

A clear description of what the bug is:
The bug is that each time we add the index of the element which returns true in the `checkString`, the adding place is always in the front of the `result` list. This is a bug because index that is added late will appear in the front of the `result` list compared with the index that is added early, which violate the order they appeared in the input list.

The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug:
bash test.sh

A description of what to edit to fix the bug:
In the ListExample.java, change `result.add(0,i);` to `result.add(i);`

# Part 2 – Reflection
One cool topic we addressed is the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. These are cool because these commands allow me to modify code in my local computer and update the modification in the github online. Therefore, I can implement my project interactively online and offline. Another cool topic is `vim`, because when we do not have available editor tools, `vim` allows us to edit files in the terminal. Also, `vim` has lots of powerful tools for editing like replacing keywords at once.
