Description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is: 
As we can see from the Junit test output, the expected list output is `[0, 2, 4]`. However, the actual list output is `[4, 2, 0]`, which contains the same element but with the opposite order. Therefore,we might guess that the `checkString` method is implemented correctly but the bug is probably accuring at the place where we add the index of the element which returns true in the `checkString`. The failure-inducing input is the String list provided to the filter method, which is `["s","b","s","a","s"]`.

A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try:
One leading question is that whether the index of the element which returns true in the `checkString` is added at the end of the result list each time, which is crucial to retain the same order they appeared in the input list.

A clear description of what the bug is:
The bug is that each time we add the index of the element which returns true in the `checkString`, the adding place is always in the front of the `result` list. This is a bug because index that is added late will appear in the front of the `result` list compared with the index that is added early, which violate the order they appeared in the input list.
