**I am Zheng Guo, and this is the fourth lab report.**
**In this report, I will reproduce the task 4-9 in the lab and for each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), I will take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys I pressed to get to that step. 
# Step 1 Log into ieng6

Keys pressed: 
1. I firstly type `ssh cs15lfa23jj@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and I `<enter>` to let the command run. The summarization of this command is that I use `ssh` with the course specific account to do the remotely connecting and get access to the remote server in the ieng6.

# Step 2 Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

Keys pressed:
1. I firstly type `git clone git@github.com:ZhengGuo-1/lab7.git` and I `<enter>` to let the command run. The summarization of this command is that I use the ssh URL for the lab7 repository for the git clone in order to clone the repository in the current working directory in the remote server in the ieng6.

# Step 3 Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys pressed:
1. I firstlt type `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up>` and I `<enter>` to let the command run. The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was 4 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it. Then the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ... command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.
