# Blog Post Vim
**I am Zheng Guo, and this is the fourth lab report.**
**In this report, I will reproduce the task 4-9 in the lab and for each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), I will take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys I pressed to get to that step. 
# Step 1 Log into ieng6

Keys pressed: 
1. I firstly type `ssh cs15lfa23jj@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and I `<enter>` to let the command run. The summarization of this command and the effect of the keypresses are that I use `ssh` with the course specific account to do the remotely connecting and get access to the remote server in the ieng6.

Keys pressed:
1. I firstly type `git clone git@github.com:ZhengGuo-1/lab7.git` and I `<enter>` to let the command run. The summarization of this command and the effect of the keypresses are that I use the ssh URL for the lab7 repository for the git clone in order to clone the repository in the current working directory in the remote server in the ieng6.

Keys pressed:
1. I type `cd lab7` and I `<enter>` to let the command run. The summarization of this command and the effect of the keypresses are that I change the current working directory to the lab7 directory in order to compile java files and run test files later. 
2. I type `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up>` and I `<enter>`. The summarization of the effect of the keypresses is that I use nine up arrows to get access to the command to compile all java files in the current working diretory since `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command was 9 up in the search history.
3. I type  `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up>` and I `<enter>`. The summarization of the effect of the keypresses is that I use eight up arrows to get access to the command to run the test java files in the current working diretory since `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command was 8 up in the search history. After I run the test java files, the Junit test output will be shown in the terminal

# Step 4 Edit the code file to fix the failing test

Keys pressed:
1. I type `vim ListExamples.java` and I `<enter>` to let the command run. The summarization of this command is that I open the content of this java file in vim in order to do the edit later.
2. I type `43j`. The effect of the keypresses are that I move the cursor to be the front of the line which is 43 lines down from the first line in the java file.
3. I type `e`. The effect of the keypress is that I move the cursor to the end of the current work, which is now under the 1.
4. I type `c2`. The effect of the keypresses are that I change the character that is under the cursor to be 2, which is exactly the correct edit.
5. I type `:wq!`. The effect of the keypresses are that I save the change and exit the vim.
