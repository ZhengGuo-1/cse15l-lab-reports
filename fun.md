* working directory:/home/lecture1
* what I got:Hello.java  messages  README appear in the terminal when I run the ls command
* why I got this:the reason why these three name appear in the terminal is because ls command shows the name of files and folders in the current directory
* whether the output is an errer: not an error
2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

* working directory:/home/lecture1
* what I got:/home/lecture1/Hello.java appear in the terminal when I run the ls command
* why I got this:the reason why /home/lecture1/Hello.java is gotten is because when the argument is the path to a file ls cannot show the information inside a file. Therefore, the output in the terminal is the same as what I type in the terminal
* whether the output is an errer: This is an error, because ls only work correctly when there is no argument or a argument with a path to a directory.
